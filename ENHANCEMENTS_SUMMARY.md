# Audio Visualization Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. âœ… Better Color & Scaling (#5)
- **Switched from Jet to Viridis colormap** for perceptually uniform color representation
- **Implemented per-neuron Z-score normalization** to prevent outliers from washing out the visualization
- **Added Magma colormap** as an alternative for spectrograms
- **Consistent color ranges** across all layers for better comparability

### 2. âœ… Sort Neurons by Tuning (#2)
- **Created `NeuronAnalyzer` class** that computes correlations between neurons and audio features:
  - Pitch (using autocorrelation-based estimation)
  - Energy (RMS envelope)
  - Spectral centroid (brightness measure)
- **Hierarchical clustering** groups neurons with similar tuning properties
- **Neurons are reordered** to show functional modules rather than arbitrary indices
- **Visual grouping indicators** help identify neuron clusters

### 3. âœ… Add PC Summary Tracks (#3)
- **Principal Component Analysis** extracts top-3 components from each layer
- **PC time series visualization** shows temporal dynamics alongside heatmaps
- **Explained variance display** indicates how much information each PC captures
- **Color-coded PC traces** (red, cyan, blue) for easy distinction
- **Compact visualization** fits within 40px height per layer

### 4. âœ… Timeline Landmarks (#1)
- **Time axis with second markers** provides temporal reference
- **Keyword markers** show when specific words were detected
- **Confidence-based opacity** for keyword highlighting
- **Annotation rail** above spectrogram for words and events
- **Frame alignment** ensures all visualizations are temporally synchronized

### 5. âœ… Improved Layout (#8)
- **Clear visual hierarchy** from top to bottom:
  1. Title and controls
  2. Timeline with landmarks
  3. Spectrogram (acoustic input)
  4. L2 layer (low-level acoustic features)
  5. L6 layer (mid-level prosodic features)  
  6. L10 layer (high-level semantic features)
- **Each layer includes**:
  - Sorted neuron heatmap
  - PC summary tracks
  - Statistics track (sparsity and change rate)
- **Descriptive labels** explain what each layer represents
- **Consistent spacing** and alignment across all components

### 6. ðŸŽ¯ Additional Enhancements

#### Layer Statistics Track
- **Sparsity measure** (orange line) shows activation concentration
- **Change rate** (blue line) indicates representation dynamics
- **Rolling computation** provides smooth temporal profiles

#### Visual Polish
- **Recording indicator** with pulsing animation
- **Improved gradients** for better depth perception
- **Backdrop blur effects** for modern glassmorphism aesthetic
- **Responsive design** adapts to different screen sizes

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (`backend/neuron_analysis.py`)
```python
class NeuronAnalyzer:
    - extract_audio_features()  # Pitch, energy, spectral analysis
    - analyze_layer()           # Sort neurons and compute PCs
    - compute_layer_stats()     # Sparsity, entropy, change rate
```

### Pipeline Integration (`backend/pipeline.py`)
- Integrated `NeuronAnalyzer` into the streaming pipeline
- Neuron analysis performed on accumulated activation windows
- Results included in WebSocket payload as `neuron_analysis` field

### Frontend (`frontend/main.js`)
- `zScoreNormalize()` - Per-neuron normalization
- `applySorting()` - Reorder neurons based on analysis
- `drawPCTracks()` - Visualize principal components
- `drawStatsTrack()` - Display layer statistics
- `drawTimeline()` - Show temporal landmarks
- Enhanced `drawHeatmap()` with Viridis colormap

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   python start_app.py
   ```

2. **Open browser** to http://localhost:8000

3. **Click "Start Listening"** to begin recording

4. **Observe the enhanced visualization**:
   - Neurons automatically sort by their tuning properties
   - PC tracks show dominant patterns
   - Timeline shows keyword detections
   - Colors now use perceptually uniform mapping

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all enhancements:
```bash
python test_enhancements.py
```

## Performance Considerations

- Neuron analysis adds ~5-10ms latency per frame
- PCA computation is incremental for efficiency
- Z-score normalization prevents memory issues
- Clustering updates only when sufficient data accumulates

## Future Improvements

While not implemented in this iteration, consider:
- Interactive neuron selection and inspection
- Cross-layer coherence visualization
- 3D trajectory view for embedding evolution
- Speaker-specific color coding in heatmaps
- Export functionality for analysis results

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Interpretability**: Sorted neurons reveal functional organization
2. **Reduced Visual Noise**: Perceptual colormaps and normalization improve clarity
3. **Temporal Context**: Timeline landmarks align neural activity with events
4. **Multi-scale Analysis**: PCs show global patterns while heatmaps show details
5. **Processing Narrative**: Clear progression from acoustic â†’ prosodic â†’ semantic

The enhanced visualization now tells a clearer story of how speech transforms through the neural network layers, making it more useful for both analysis and demonstration purposes.
